# Writing E2E Test Code

When the project is big enough, the system may be complex and interconnected with multiple sub-systems. If any of the sub-systems fails, the whole software system could collapse. Hence, introducing End-to-End (E2E) testing, a software testng method used to verify the complete system flow. E2E tests help to validate the software system and check its integration with external interfaces.

The purpose of E2E testing is to exercise a complete production like scenario to test environment and simulate real-time settings. This helps to detect issues with sub-systems and increase confidence in the overall software product. It usually executed after functional unit testing, covering integration test cases unable to be tested by unit testing alone.

This article from (Free Code Camp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-end-to-end-testing-is-important-for-your-team-cb7eb0ec1504) helps to give an overview of the importance of E2E testing on top of unit testing. [This article](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-end-to-end-testing/) also helps to give a concrete example of from designing E2E tests to performing E2E tests to evaluating E2E tests.
